# overview

We built individual-based simulations in C++ to study the co-evolution of individual and social learning. This main "folder" includes the simulation code in c++ and an example of the parameter file.

Folder "Executables" contain binary files for Windows and Linux and a short description how to use them to run the simulation.

The folder "Example data" contains example output files and the corresponding parameter file for a simulation with self-guided individual learning and socially instructed learning.

The folder "Data for figures" contains summary data files used for creating the figures.
